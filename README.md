# Timer
Timer is a web app that uses pomodoro technique (25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break) to increase user's productivity. Features include a custom timer and task log. Users do not have to be logged in to keep a running to-do list. However, users will need to sign in if they want to see a list of all their previous tasks.
